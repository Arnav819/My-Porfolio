1-- to show likelyhood of dying if you contract covid in your country

select location, date, total_cases,total_deaths,concat(round(total_deaths/total_cases*100,2),'%') as likelyhood_of_dying from CovidDeaths
where location= 'India' and continent is not null
order by 5 desc

2-- to show how much %age of total population is infected in your country

select location , date, population, total_cases, concat(round(total_cases/population*100,2),'%') as Infection_rate from coviddeaths
where location ='India' and continent = 'Asia'
order by 5 desc 

3-- to show highest infection rate compared to population by country

concat(round(max(total_cases/population)*100,2),'%') as highest_infection_rate from coviddeaths
 where continent is not null   group by location, population, continent

4-- to show countries with highest death count

6-- to show percentage of population that has received atleast one vaccine date by date

with cte as ( select continent,location,population,date,new_vaccinations,
